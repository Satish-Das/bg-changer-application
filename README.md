# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Background Changer Application

The application consists of 11 color buttons, each labeled with a specific color name, positioned at the bottom of the screen.

#Features:
-> Interactive Design:
Users can instantly change the background color of the application by clicking on one of the 11 buttons (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Olive, Gray, etc.).

#Clear Instruction:
-> The interface displays a central message: "Click Given below Color Button for change backgroundColor," guiding users on how to interact with the application.

#Color Palette:
-> The buttons are styled with their corresponding colors, making it easy for users to choose a desired background theme.

#Modern UI/UX:
-> The app features a clean and minimalistic layout, with vibrant colors for better user engagement.

This application can be a fun and simple tool to demonstrate React state management and event handling while also serving as an example of interactive UI design.
